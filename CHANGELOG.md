### Code Refactoring

* remove support for custom thumbs via `children` ([3cb3413](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/3cb3413))


### Features

* "handle" and "bar" are now "thumb" and "track" to follow `input[type=range]` nomenclature ([e4e8ff8](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/e4e8ff8))
* `ariaValuetext` now supports a function for dynamic value text ([021a547](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/021a547))
* `renderThumb` now renders the entire thumb node rather than just the thumb content ([669dcdb](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/669dcdb))
* `withTracks` is now true by default ([a450420](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/a450420))
* add `renderBar` render prop for customizing bar content ([0de9013](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/0de9013))
* add `renderHandle` render prop for dynamic handle content ([c87ed4b](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/c87ed4b))
* add `valueNow` to state objects of `ariaValuetext` and `renderThumb` for easier access to the current value ([94712f2](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/94712f2))
* add aria-orientation to slider ([5125a98](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/5125a98))
* add support for Page Up and Page Down keys ([ed67408](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/ed67408))
* pass `value` state to render props ([8b0615d](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/8b0615d))
* remove dependency on create-react-class ([648512e](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/648512e))
* the paging value is now configurable via the `pageFn` prop ([de75419](https://github.com/zillow/react-slider/commit/de75419))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The render props `renderThumb` and `renderTrack` are now passed two arguments
instead of one, `props` and `state`. This makes it easier to just spread props when using
a render function.
* `renderThumb` was previously given the indexed handle value
which now needs to be derived from `value` and `index.
* custom thumbs via `children` is no longer supported.
To customize thumbs, use the `renderThumb` render prop instead.
* `withTracks` is more commonly true than false,
so we are making that the default
* "handle" and "bar" props have been renamed to "thumb" and "track",
e.g. `withBars` is now `withTracks`, and `handleClassName` is now `thumbClassName`
